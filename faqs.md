### How Do I Join
Because we prioritise building a community, we heavily suggest that you join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NUVZCumQXB), and attend any workshops you find interesting.

### When Are Meetings
We try to hold a workshop every week, Monday 1-2 PM at E2-506. All workshop resources and practice challenges will be available online.

### What Happens at a Meeting
When we do host a meeting, it is usually centered on a central idea or topic, such as reverse engineering. A single speaker will typically prepare slides and a demonstration of the topic, going over the fundamentals and any prerequisites. Throughout the workshop, we will take breaks to allow you to practice the new skills you learned by completing [short *and optional* challenges](./faqs#what-is-a-ctf-competition) to see how well you understand them (this also helps us know if we're going too fast or too slow), such as obtaining a password from a password-protected file. Workshops are open to discussion and questions, so if you're curious about why something happened or what key was pressed to bring up that screen, just ask!

### What Is a CTF Competition
*Capture The Flags, or CTFs, are a kind of computer security competition. Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skills.*

More information can be found at [CTFD's "What's a CTF?"](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/).

### How Can I Prepare
If you're reading this, it means we haven't finished our "Getting Started" page yet. In the meantime, you can look into downloading [Kali Linux WSL2](https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex/). All of our workshops will notify you of any prerequisites that you need and a guide on how to install them.

### I'm Not a CS Major
That's fine! We welcome anyone who is interested in learning about computer security, regardless of major. We even have an economics major on our CTF team!

### I Missed a Workshop
If you miss a workshop, don't worry! All workshop resources and practice challenges will be available online, so you can catch up at your own pace. You can also join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NUVZCumQXB) to ask questions and get help from other members.

### What Topics Do You Cover
We cover a wide range of cybersecurity topics, including but not limited to: web security, reverse engineering, cryptography, forensics, and more. Our workshops and events are designed to be informative and engaging, and we strive to cover both fundamental and advanced topics to appeal to a variety of skill levels.

### I Have More Questions
If you have any further questions, please ask them on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NUVZCumQXB) or contact us via any of the accounts listed at the bottom of any page.

UC Santa Cruz is proud to announce our outstanding 2nd place finish in the [Department of Energy's CyberForce 2021](https://cyberforce.energy.gov/) competition. This marked UCSC's first time participating in CyberForce, and our team proved their mettle by securing a top position among 120 teams from 105 universities across 33 states.

### About the Competition
The CyberForce Competition is a prestigious cybersecurity event hosted by the Department of Energy (DoE) aimed at training and developing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. By combining Capture the Flag (CTF) and cyber defense/offense exercises, this competition allows participants to hone their skills and knowledge in a realistic and engaging environment. The event also fosters collaboration between academia, industry, and government to advance cybersecurity research and education, thus promoting the growth of the cybersecurity workforce.

### About UCSC's Team
In the 2021 edition of CyberForce, UCSC competed against other universities to defend a simulated energy infrastructure against cyberattacks. The challenge required our team to implement effective cybersecurity strategies, maintain system functionality, and protect sensitive information from adversaries. UCSC's team demonstrated exceptional skills and expertise, earning second place behind the University of Central Florida and ahead of Pennsylvania State University.

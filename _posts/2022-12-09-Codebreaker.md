Following the academic tradition of participating in the [National Security Agency's Codebreaker Challenge](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home), Slug Security is proud to announce that we have won 3rd place in the 2022 Codebreaker Challenge. This is the third year in a row that UC Santa Cruz has placed in the top 10. We are very proud of our team's accomplishments, and we look forward to participating in the 2023 Codebreaker Challenge!

### About the Challenge
The Codebreaker Challenge (CBC) is a competition hosted by the National Security Agency (NSA) for students to raise awareness of cybersecurity and encourage students to pursue careers in cybersecurity. The competition consists of multiple challenges, each of which is a real-world cybersecurity problem. The challenges are designed to be accessible to students of all skill levels, and the competition is open to all students in the United States. 

This year, the competition drew over 4,800 participants from 450 schools and ran from August 8th to December 9th.

### About UCSC's Team
This year, UCSC was represented by a total of 94 participants, including 86 students, 7 alumni, and [Alvaro A. Cardenas](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~alacarde/), the club's faculty advisor and an associate professor of computer science and engineering at UCSC. Out of all teams that participated, UCSC ranked 2nd in terms of solvers. 

Participants that solved all challenges were awarded a medallion and a signed letter from Paul M. Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency and chief of the Central Security Service. Those solvers representing UCSC are Jeffrey Zhang, Brian Mak, Steven Mak, Nancy Lau, Iakov Taranenko, Jackson Kohls, Maxwell Kunes, and Victor Ho.

### This Year's Challenge
This year's challenge scenario was a ransomware attack on a fictional company. Participants, acting as NSA analysts, worked with the FBI to investigate the attack through 9 challenges of varying difficulty. The investigation started with analyzing VPN logs to determine the compromised account, and then progressed to studying the ransomware software used in the attack. The next step involved finding a hackers' forum that served as a market and platform for ransomware.

To further the investigation, participants needed to leverage SQL injection vulnerabilities on the forum's website to access the administrator's account and the attackers' key database. Finally, participants reverse-engineered the ransomware software to uncover the encryption key and recover the victim's data.

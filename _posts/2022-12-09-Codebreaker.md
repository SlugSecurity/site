### About the Codebreaker Challenge
The Codebreaker Challenge is a competition hosted by the National Security Agency (NSA) for students to raise awareness of cybersecurity and to encourage students to pursue careers in cybersecurity. The competition consists of 10 challenges, each of which is a real-world cybersecurity problem. The challenges are designed to be accessible to students of all skill levels, and the competition is open to all students in the United States. 

This year, the competition was held from August 8th to December 9th. The competition had over 4800 registered participants from almost 450 schools.

### About UCSC's Team
This year, UCSC was represented by a total of 94 participants, including 86 students, 7 alumni, and [Alvaro A. Cardenas](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~alacarde/), the club's faculty advisor and an associate professor of computer science and engineering at UCSC. Out of all teams that participated, UCSC ranked 2nd in terms of solvers. 

Participants that solved all challenges were awarded a medallion and a signed letter from Paul M. Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency and chief of the Central Security Service. Those participants being Jeffrey Zhang, Brian Mak, Steven Mak, Nancy Lau, Iakov Taranenko, Jackson Kohls, Maxwell Kunes, and Victor Ho.

### This Year's Challenge
This year's scenario involved a ransomware attack on a fictional company, and it your job as an NSA analyst to help the FBI investigate the attack. The challenge consisted of 9 challenges, each of which was worth a varying amount of points based on their difficulty. During the competition, participants started with analysis of VPN logs to identify which account was compromised, and then moved on to investigating the ransomware software used in the attack. Later moving on to find a hacking forum that the attackers used to facilitate a market and forum for ransomware. 

After investigating the forum, participants had to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in the forum's website to gain access to an administrator's account and the attackers's key database. Finally, participants had to reverse engineering the ransomware software to find the encryption key used to encrypt the victim's files and recover the data.

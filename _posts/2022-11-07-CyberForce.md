Slug Security is proud to announce that, representing UC Santa Cruz, we placed 9th out of 170 teams in the 2022 CyberForce Competition. This is the second year in a row that UCSC has placed in the top 10 in the [Department of Energy's CyberForce Competition](https://cyberforce.energy.gov/). We want to especially congratulate our 3 CTF teams that represented us this year, "Slug Sec", "Bing Chilling", and "Cyber Slugs". All three teams were supervised by Professor [Alvaro A. Cardenas](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~alacarde/) and [Sebasti√°n Castro](https://twitter.com/r4wd3r).

### About the Competition

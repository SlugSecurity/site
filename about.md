### About the Club
The goal of the University of California, Santa Cruz Security Club is to equip students with the abilities and information required to safeguard both physical and digital systems. To teach students how to overcome obstacles and defend systems, the club holds lectures, invites speakers, hosts tutorials, and holds/competes in capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Students have the chance to network with security experts, other students interested in security and learn about the most recent security technologies. We are not just a club for computer science majors, but for anyone with an interest in cyber or physical security. **No prior experience is necessary, and all are welcome!**

### What is a Capture the Flag (CTF) Competition?
*Capture The Flags, or CTFs, are a kind of computer security competition. Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skills.*

<p>Welcome to Slug Security, UCSC’s security club! We are a group of students who are passionate about all things related to security, from learning about the latest technology and techniques used to protect against cyber threats to discussing ways to improve physical security on campus.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide a space for students to come together to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects related to security. We hold regular meetings and workshops, where members can learn new skills and share their expertise with others. We also work on real-world projects, such as conducting security research and competing in technical Capture The Flag events.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in joining us, please feel free to attend one of our future meetings or join <a href="https://discord.gg/NUVZCumQXB">our Discord server</a>. We look forward to meeting you and building a community around cybersecurity!</p>

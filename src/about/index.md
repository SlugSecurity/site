### Who We Are
Slug Security is a student organization at the University of California, Santa Cruz, dedicated to fostering a community of people who are passionate about cybersecurity. If you've ever thought of taking something apart to see how it works, or you've thought about outsmarting a system to do something it wasn't designed to do, then you're in the right place.

### What We Do
Think workshops, social gatherings, and some serious (but fun) competitions. Most of our events are held online (what would hacking be without the internet?), but we also have some in-person events, those being held at the Baskin School of Engineering. See [our events page](/events) for more information on what we have planned.

For specifics, heres what we mainly do:
- **Projects**: Projects on various things security, from creating CTFs, to web-development, to hardware hacking.
	- Student-led & team based

### How to Become a Member
You can become a member by joining [our Discord server](/discord) and attending any workshops you find interesting. To speed up your registration process during competitions, please see our [join page](/join).

### When Are Meetings
See upcoming events and meetings on our [events page](/events). All workshop resources and practice challenges will be accessible online.

### What Happens at a Meeting
When we do host a meeting, it is usually centered on a central idea or topic, such as reverse engineering. A single speaker will typically prepare slides and a demonstration of the topic, going over the fundamentals and any prerequisites. Throughout the workshop, we will take breaks to allow you to practice the new skills you learned by completing [short challenges](./faqs#what-is-a-ctf-competition) to see how well you understand them (this also helps us know if we're going too fast or too slow), such as obtaining a password from a password-protected file. Workshops are open to discussion and questions, so if you're curious about why something happened or what key was pressed to bring up that screen, just ask!

### What Is a CTF Competition
*Capture The Flags, or CTFs, are a kind of computer security competition. Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skills.*

No worries! We gladly welcome anyone interested in learning about computer security, regardless of their major. In fact, we have an economics major on our CTF team!

### Topics We Cover
Our club explores a diverse array of cybersecurity topics, such as web security, reverse engineering, cryptography, forensics, and beyond. We design our workshops and events to be both informative and engaging while addressing fundamental and advanced subjects to cater to various skill levels.

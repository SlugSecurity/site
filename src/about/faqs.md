## Who We Are

Student-ran org under Baskin Engineering focused on all things computer security. All programming comes from students, with faculty oversight for leadership. Originally founded as Security Santa Cruz in 2014, rebranded to Slug Security in 2022.

TLDR: do cool stuff with computers.

This group is open to all students consistent with state and federal law, the UC Nondiscrimination Statement and the Nondiscrimination Policy Statement for University of California Publications Regarding Student-Related Matters.

## What We Do

![Socialize](https://placehold.co/600x400/1F1F1F/FF5722?text=Socialize){ align=left }

### Socialize (mainly)

Our [Discord](/discord) is where most of the action happens. Sharing cybersecurity news, talking about industry events, showing off cool projects, asking for help when you're stuck.

*Follow us on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/slugsec) to see the fun side of the club.*

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

![Learn](https://placehold.co/600x400/1F1F1F/FF5722?text=Learn){ align=right }

### Learn

Hands-on workshops and working sessions. We show you a concept, explain why it matters, then let you go free range on a practice environment. Everything runs on our Cyber Range (our club server rack) where we spin up vulnerable machines, emulate networks, and host challenges. Open to all unless marked cohort-only (check event details). No prerequisites unless stated.

![Compete](https://placehold.co/600x400/1F1F1F/FF5722?text=Compete){ align=left }

### Compete

Diverse competitions throughout the year, mostly online, some in-person. See [Competitions](#competitions) below for the different types we participate in.

![Projects](https://placehold.co/600x400/1F1F1F/FF5722?text=Projects){ align=right }

### Club Projects

Applied hacking on real stuff. Bug bounties, securing university systems, and personal projects. For example, hacking routers and IP cameras, porting Doom onto a handheld scanner, reverse engineering alarm systems with RF hardware, building radio scanner tools.

## Competitions

![CTF](https://placehold.co/600x400/1F1F1F/FF5722?text=CTF){ align=left }

### Capture the Flags

Jeopardy-style hacking competitions that run over a weekend (usually 48 hours). Small computer puzzles (like leetcode but for hacking) across categories like web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, forensics, and binary exploitation. Each challenge has a hidden flag, submit it for points. Harder challenges are worth more.

Hosted by universities, security companies, and hacking groups worldwide. *We encourage members to write up their solutions and post them on our [writeups](/writeups) page.*

### Cyber Defense

Blue team competitions where you defend a network while red teamers (hackers) try to break in. You're keeping services running, handling business tasks, and responding to security incidents all at once.

For example, CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition) is the largest in the US. Your 8-person team inherits a corporate network full of vulnerabilities. You're patching systems, responding to intrusions, and answering fake customer service tickets while professional pentesters actively attack you. Each competition day runs 9-5. The season structure: invitationals (open practice runs), qualifiers (regional teams only), regionals (top 8 from quals), then nationals. We compete in the Western region.

### Attack/Defend

Competitions where you build something secure, then attack other teams' implementations while they attack yours.

For example, MITRE's eCTF (Embedded Capture the Flag) is a semester-long competition focused on embedded systems. First phase (~2 months): design and build a secure system based on their specs (past challenges have included satellite TV decoders and medical devices). Second phase (~1-2 months): break into other teams' implementations.

## I'm Not a CS Major

Good, we need you. Security touches everything, so we need people who understand everything. Policy, psychology, economics, design, law, hardware, biology. The field has a blind spot when everyone comes from the same background. We've had economics majors, politics majors, and art majors contribute to CTF teams and club projects.

## Rules

- Treat everyone with respect
- Don't be condescending
- Be friendly to beginners
- Adhere to ethical practices
- Don't be evil

Computer crime is a real thing (18 U.S.C. 1030). If you're unsure whether something is unethical, ask us.

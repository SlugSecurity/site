### Becoming A Member
As students and hobbyists passionate about cybersecurity, we welcome everyone to our community, no matter your experience or identity. Our membership requirements are flexible, and to be considered an official "member," here's what you need to do:

- **Engage with the Community**: We're not saying to send hourly messages, but it's great to chat, meet new people, and build a sense of community!
- **Participate in Workshops and Meetings**: Enhance your knowledge and network by attending workshops or meetings that interest you.
- **Get Involved in Competitions**: Dive into competitions with us for a true hands-on experience, crucial for honing your hacking skills, regardless of your experience level.

### How to Join
To join, simply fill out the registration form below (you'll need a UCSC account to access it). After that, you'll automatically be added to our mailing list and our shared drive, where you can find all of our resources and information. We also recommend joining our Discord server to stay up-to-date with our events and to chat with other members.

You can also join our Discord server without being a member, but we highly recommend joining to get the full experience of our community. Regardless, we're excited to have you join us!

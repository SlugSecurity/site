## Becoming A Member
We welcome everyone to our community regardless of experience or background. Joining is as simple as filling out the registration form below and hopping into our Discord.

## Active Member Status
Being an **active member** gets you priority for competitions, recognition within the club, and access to member-only opportunities. Active status resets each quarter, so you'll need to stay involved to keep it.

To be an active member for the quarter, you need to:

1. :octicons-verified-16: **Get verified** in our Discord server
2. :octicons-flame-16: **Stay engaged** by doing **one** of the following:
	- Attend two official club events, **OR**
	- Reach the activity threshold in Discord

## How to Join
Fill out the registration form below to get added to our mailing list and shared drive with all our resources. You'll need a UCSC account to access it. Then join our Discord server to stay in the loop on events and start working toward active member status.
